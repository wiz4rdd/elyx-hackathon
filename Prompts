1 full diagnostic test panel needs to be done for the member every three
months to check their progress on different biomarkers.
Assume the member also does some research or reads about health or gets
curious questions about certain topics. So, there should be up to 5
conversations started by the member per week on average.
The member is committing 5 hours per week on average to follow the plan.
Assume exercises are being updated every 2 weeks based on the client's
progress.
The member travels for at least 1 week out of every 4 weeks on business
trips.
The members’ primary place of residence is Singapore.
If you are generating report communication, assume you can just have text
messages highlighting either the areas which have problems or tracking of
something which the member or team cares about.
When Elyx proposes a plan, the member sticks to it properly ~50% of the
time. That means ~50% of the time, the plan needs to be changed or
improved based on the members preferences / logistics constraints.
Remember, the member is generally not sick, but they can have 1 chronic
condition that they are managing (eg. high sugar, high BP) - also  check on this points and again start the conversation from 25th april in the specific manner

make the starting of the conversation as the member approaches first time in elyx

WEEK 1 (April 25 – May 1)
[4/25/25, 8:09 AM] Rohan:
Morning, Ruby. Saw I’m up 4kg since March and last week’s fasting glucose was 121. Should I be worried, or is it just due to snacking when travelling? - starting like this is good, but by the time, all tests are done, every 3 months

distribute the chats over the week, not all texts in a single day

focus more on scheduling the3 tests, not only on questioning, yes member can ask 1-2 questions a week, but more on about his plans and decisions he has to follow

use dates for scheduling instead of dates

now continue the conversation at the same style manner and rate - making it a real life conversation story between a member to elyx, for the next 2 weeks

check the dates, our conversation was last on 1st may

now do the same for the next week, maintaining the continuity of story and the episodes given in the pdf with the restriction/rules of chat as our last talk was on 15th may

now do the same for next 7 days from 23rd may, and add up Clarification, Data Gathering & Initial Workout Plan

continue the plan and also add up  Member Dissatisfaction & Service Feedback and again convincing the member. starting from 30th may

now do the same for the next 10 days from 3rd june and add up  Health Optimization Plan & Continued Feedback, continuing the story and schedules for tests

do the same for next 15 days from 14th june but this time add up Medical Coordination & Device Management, remembering all the constraints from the pdf and continuing the storyline and all the deadlines and schedules

do the next for 5 days from 30th june on Disagreement on Medical Advice & AI Capabilities and again convincing aftern continuing the story flow and schedules of test and also the constraints on member and conversation

Now according to the constraints and maintaining the continuity and flow of story line with schedules, give me the conversations of next 15 days X 10 times

Now according to the constraints and maintaining the continuity and flow of story line with schedules, give me the conversations of next 15 days from 16th nov, starting up the final tests so see the improvements,showing statistical improvements so that we can wrap up within december

Now according to the constraints and maintaining the continuity and flow of story line with schedules, give me the conversations of next 25 days from 1st dec, wrapping up all the procedure and plans, and final test results and completeing the timeline and storyline of the member.
